# Project configurations for automated node deployments
# Each project represents a node deployment repository that Ponos can manage
projects:
  # Ethereum consensus client example
  - network: ethereum
    project_name: eth-consensus-client
    owner: your-org
    name: ethereum-deployments
    branch: main
    paths:
      - "deployments/prysm/values.yaml"
      - "deployments/lighthouse/values.yaml"
      - "k8s/ethereum/prysm-deployment.yaml"

  # Ethereum execution client example  
  - network: ethereum
    project_name: eth-execution-client
    owner: your-org
    name: ethereum-deployments
    branch: main
    paths:
      - "deployments/geth/values.yaml"
      - "deployments/nethermind/values.yaml"
      - "k8s/ethereum/geth-deployment.yaml"

  # Polkadot validator example
  - network: polkadot
    project_name: polkadot-validator
    owner: your-org
    name: polkadot-infrastructure
    branch: main
    paths:
      - "helm/polkadot/values.yaml"
      - "k8s/polkadot-deployment.yaml"
      - "docker-compose/polkadot.yml"

  # Cosmos Hub validator example
  - network: cosmos
    project_name: cosmos-validator
    owner: your-org
    name: cosmos-infrastructure
    branch: main
    paths:
      - "deployments/gaiad/values.yaml"
      - "k8s/cosmos-deployment.yaml"

  # Arbitrum node example
  - network: arbitrum
    project_name: arbitrum-node
    owner: your-org
    name: layer2-infrastructure
    branch: main
    paths:
      - "arbitrum/nitro/values.yaml"
      - "k8s/arbitrum-deployment.yaml"

  # Optimism node example
  - network: optimism
    project_name: optimism-node
    owner: your-org
    name: layer2-infrastructure
    branch: main
    paths:
      - "optimism/op-node/values.yaml"
      - "optimism/op-geth/values.yaml"
      - "k8s/optimism-deployment.yaml"

# Configuration Notes:
# 
# network: The network name (must match supported networks in agent-core)
# project_name: Unique identifier for this node deployment project
# owner: GitHub organization or username that owns the repository
# name: Repository name containing node deployment configurations
# branch: Git branch to target for automated updates (typically 'main' or 'develop')
# paths: List of file paths that contain node client configurations
#
# Supported file formats:
# - Kubernetes YAML manifests (deployment, statefulset, etc.)
# - Helm values.yaml files
# - Docker Compose files
# - Custom configuration files with image tags
#
# Path examples:
# - "k8s/deployment.yaml" - Kubernetes deployment manifest
# - "helm/charts/node/values.yaml" - Helm chart values
# - "docker/docker-compose.yml" - Docker Compose configuration
# - "config/client-config.toml" - Client-specific configuration files
#
# Security Notes:
# - Ensure repository access is properly configured
# - Use GitHub Apps or Personal Access Tokens with minimal required permissions
# - Configure branch protection rules for production deployments
# - Enable required status checks and reviews for automated PRs
#
# Network Support:
# Ponos currently supports automated upgrades for:
# - Ethereum (execution & consensus clients)
# - Polkadot & Kusama
# - Cosmos SDK chains
# - Layer 2 solutions (Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon)
# - And more - check the agent-core documentation for the latest list
